# TO DO
1. Math: stats, probability, special functions, simulation (i.e. random gen), Statistical tests, OLS
2. Finance: Black-scholes, fixed income/bond, time value of money, swaps, forwards, exotics
3. Image: Effects, detection, recognition
4. Data: Dataframe, plots
5. Simulation: random gen, brownian motion, multi dimensional vector gen
6. Machine Learning (ML): OLS, Logisict, ARIMA, Naive Bayes, SVM, DT, RF, XGB, RNN

My immediate pain point is to use simulation (including agent based simulation) for solving certain problems. For this I need:
1. random number/path generator
2. Graphical visualization
3. Agent based modeling framework
