# libs
Libraries that can be used on the browser or backend applications.

There will be a common set of js libraries that will be directly included in some of the other apps we are developing (jsnb/mappy etc). 
The libs will be categorised into:
1. ml (Machine learning including timeseries)
2. math (Math functions not defined in core Math module)
3. finance (Financial clauclations including NPY, IRR, Yield, Fixed Income and option pricing)
4. image (image processing libs including AR/VR)
5. vision (image recognition)
