# di-libs

A collection of JavaScript libraries that can be used seamlessly in both browser and backend applications. These libraries are designed to support a variety of functionalities ranging from math operations to financial calculations, machine learning, and image processing.

## How to Use

To include the libraries in your project, add the following script from GitHub Pages:

```html
<script src="https://gopi-suvanam.github.io/di-libs/build/di-libs.js"></script>
```

These libraries will serve as a common foundation for several projects, such as [jsnb](https://github.com/gopi-suvanam/jsnb) and [mappy](https://github.com/gopi-suvanam/mappy), enabling easy reuse across different applications.
